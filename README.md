# Action grid

# Using
 For start using this package add lines into `./Packages/manifest.json` like next sample:  
 ```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "astar.action-grid": "https://github.com/k0dep/astar.action-grid.git#0.1.0"
  }
}
```
 Instead `#0.1.0` paste version what you need.  
 > *2018.3* After include dependency in manifest, you must manual add [astar](https://github.com/k0dep/astar) dependency in manifest
